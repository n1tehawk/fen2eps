1. Starting the program
-----------------------

Since it reads from `stdin' and writes to `stdout' the easiest way to start
Fen2eps is:

  fen2eps < a.fen > a.eps

where the file `a.fen' contains the FEN data and `a.eps' is the created
EPS file. For further information about the available command-line options
take a look into the manual, please.


2. How to compile it
--------------------

The following intructions assume that you unZIPed the source archive
`fen2eps1_1src.zip'.

2.1 Unix/Linux
--------------

Change into the created directory `fen2eps'.

Now, all you have to do is say

  make

and soon afterwards the compilation process should have produced the executable
`fen2eps'.

If this didn`t work and you get an error saying that the compiler `g++' was not
found, you have to edit the `Makefile' and change the variable

  CC=g++

to the C++ compiler that is actually installed on your system.

For all the SCons fans out there, I added a simple "SConstruct"...so
the usual "scons" should do the trick ;).

2.2. DOS/Windows
----------------

Start your favorite C++ compiler and tell it to compile the file
`fen2eps.cpp'. With a bit of luck it doesn't complain and you get
the application `fen2eps.exe'....

Again, assuming SCons is properly installed and finds a default
compiler, a simple "scons" at the command prompt creates 
an executable too.


3. Source code documentation
----------------------------

The source code file includes special comments for generating a documentation
using the program "Doxygen" (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen). 
For further information read its manual.
